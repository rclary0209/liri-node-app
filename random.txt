node liri.js do-what-it-says

Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

It should run spotify-this-song for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in random.txt.
Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this.
