This app serves as an entertainment guru. It allows the user to search various API's for information on movies, live performances, and music. 

It gathers information from Spotify such as a song's name, link to it on Spotify, the album it's from, and if the user input is blank it will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.
This is demonstrated in the spotify-this.png file. 


It will also access concert info from the bands in my town API to find information about your favorite artists such as when they are performing, the venue name, and location. 
This is demonstrated in the concert-this.png file. 

And finally, it provides movie information from the IMDB database. For any movie you input it will give you the: title of the move,year it was released, its rating, country it was produced in, its' language, plot, and cast information. If no movie is input, the data defaults to Mr. Nobody. This is demonstrated in the movie-this.png file.
